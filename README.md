## Skateboard (2.1-2.5)

### Description

This project was to create a model of a skateboard with realistic size and weight.

### Reflection

**2.1**

  2.1 included the creation of the deck itself. The holes in the deck were created using the hole feature so that they would fit specific sized bolts correctly. 
  
**2.2**

  In 2.2, the extrude function was used to create multiple parts within the same part studio, by pressing "new" instead of "add" when extruding. 
  
**2.3**

  The wheels were created using the revolve feature to quickly create the whole wheel with minimal work.
  
**2.4**

  When putting the parts together, standard content bolts and nuts were used, as well as working with different types of mates within onshape.
  
**2.5**

  In order to make the skateboard look more realistic, I had to bend the board and change the shape of the trucks. This used the split and move face tool which made it easier to   change the angle of the deck without creating new sketches and extrudes. When changing the trucks, I discovered multiple issues with my original design that made it more         difficult to change dimensions without breaking parts of the trucks. In the future confirm that the dimensions and constraints are not over or under constrained that way if     there in a need to change dimensions it can be done easily.
