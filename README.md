## Skateboard (2.1-2.5)

### Description

Creating a deck, trucks, and wheels, with realistic weight and proportions, using onshape functions such as, hole, revolve, and a variety of mates when assembling the final product.

### Reflection

**2.1**

  The hole function allows simple creation of holes fit for specific bolt types. It was used here to create the holes to attach the trucks to the deck.
  
**2.2**

  You can create multiple parts within one part studio by pressing "new" when extruding a sketch. This allows to model parts within one part studio and then import them seperately for assembly. 
  
**2.3**

  The revolve function revolves a sketch around a chosen axis of rotation. This allows to extrude a circular part, such as a wheel, with ease. 
  
**2.4**

  Fastened mates create a fixed connection between two parts in an assembly. This is most common because it connects parts together neatly like it were glue. Revolute mates connect parts as well, but it allows for rotational movement. This was useful for connecting the wheels to the Truck Hanger while still allowing the wheels to spin freely. 
  
**2.5**

  In order to make the skateboard look more realistic, I had to bend the board and change the shape of the trucks. This used the split and move face tool which made it easier to   change the angle of the deck without creating new sketches and extrudes. When changing the trucks, I discovered multiple issues with my original design that made it more         difficult to change dimensions without breaking parts of the trucks. In the future confirm that the dimensions and constraints are not over or under constrained that way if     there in a need to change dimensions it can be done easily.

### Reflection

**3.1**

  Adding mate connectors within the part studio itself allows you to edit them using variables like in this assignment and it also makes things easier once in the assembly.

**3.2**

  Part/feature configurations make changing parts much easier within the part studio and when adding parts to an assembly. The feature configuration creates a table for you to     input values for variables and feature settings.  

**3.3**

The work done in the other parts of this assignment made the actual assembly incredibly easy. When importing blocks the feature configurations made before allowed to easily import all types of blocks that I wanted, and in the color that I wanted. Adding the mate connectors in 3.1 allowed the blocks to easily snap together in the assembly.
